# simple_rack_app

- For me to understand how Rack applications work by building a simple Sinatra-like Rack app.
- All is based on the article ["Let's Build a Sinatra"](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/lets-build-a-sinatra) by Gabe Berke-Williams. Thank you so much.

## Rack
- specifies a standard interface for Ruby webservers

## Sinatra
- a layer on top of Rack
- DSL for specifying what a Rack app responds to, and what it sends back
- Enable us to quickly create web applications in Ruby
