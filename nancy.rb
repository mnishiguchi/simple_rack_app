# Store routes (like GET /hello) and actions to take when hitting those routes.
# For each request, it will match the requested route to the stored routes, and
# take action if thereâ€™s a match, or return a 404 if nothing matches.

# Block handlers must return something that Rack can understand.

#==> TEST

# 1. Run `ruby nancy.rb`
# 2. Visit http://localhost:9292/hello                   => existent GET route
# 3. Visit http://localhost:9292/hola                    => non-existent GET route
# 4. Visit http://localhost:9292/?foo=bar&hello=goodbye  => show params
# 5. $ curl --data "body is hello" localhost:9292/       => POST route
# 6. Hit Ctrl-c to quit

# Instantiate the Nancy::Base class
nancy = Nancy::Base.new

# Add a GET request route
nancy.get "/hello" do
  [200, {}, ["Hello world"]]
end

# Add the root route that displays params
nancy.get "/" do
  [200, {}, ["Your params are #{params}"]]
end

# Add a POST request route
nancy.post "/" do
  [200, {}, request.body]
end

# Print all the routes
ap nancy.routes

# Run the app using the server WEBrick that is built in to Ruby.
Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run nancy, Port: 9292
