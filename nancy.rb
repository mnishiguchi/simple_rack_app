# Store routes (like GET /hello) and actions to take when hitting those routes.
# For each request, it will match the requested route to the stored routes, and
# take action if thereâ€™s a match, or return a 404 if nothing matches.

#==> TEST - Run ruby nancy.rb

# Instantiate the Nancy::Base class
nancy = Nancy::Base.new

# Add a GET request route
nancy.get "/hello" do

end

# Print the routes
ap nancy.routes
