require "rack"

# A base Sinatra-like class that other classes can inherit from.
# https://robots.thoughtbot.com/lets-build-a-sinatra

# Store routes (like GET /hello) and actions to take when hitting those routes.
# For each request, it will match the requested route to the stored routes, and
# take action if thereâ€™s a match, or return a 404 if nothing matches.

# Block handlers must return something that Rack can understand.
