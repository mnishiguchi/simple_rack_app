# Store routes (like GET /hello) and actions to take when hitting those routes.
# For each request, it will match the requested route to the stored routes, and
# take action if thereâ€™s a match, or return a 404 if nothing matches.

# Block handlers must return something that Rack can understand.

#==> TEST
# 1. Run `ruby nancy.rb`
# 2. Visit http://localhost:9292/hello
# 3. Hit Ctrl-c to quit

# Instantiate the Nancy::Base class
nancy = Nancy::Base.new

# Add a GET request route
nancy.get "/hello" do
  [200, {}, ["Nancy says hello"]]
end

# Print all the routes
ap nancy.routes

# Run the app using the server WEBrick that is built in to Ruby.
Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run nancy, Port: 9292
